STRATEGY

1) Focus - Whats worth doing?
A site where client can specify their needs for software on their indicators (control units).

2) Definition - What are we creating?
Creating an intuative way that a client can easily navigate through different software options to narrow down on their specific industry and product
requirements.

3) Value - What value does it provide?
It provides the client with a simple appealing way to define their needs that is tailored to them. It provides the company with clarity of the clients needs
and encourages prospective customer engagement.

SCOPE

4) What features will be available?
Nav bar to easily move around websit. Nested list of different software possibilities for the client to choose from based on their industry and product. 
Contact us form to fill in requesting further information.

5) What content will there be?
About us description of JWS. Information on what different software packages can do relative to industry and product and how they can benefit the client. 
Implementation & service section to explain how the solution would be implemented and how support would be provided.

STRUCTURE

6) How are you going to design user interaction?
Nav bar taking client to 4 pages Home, Software Solution, Implementation & Services, Contact Us. The client will be able plot their way to their desired 
soultion based on their industry and product needs from top to bottom. The form to be filled out requesting further information will be on the last page.

7) How will the information architecture look?
About us section on homepage and breif description of what we do in 3 sections. Information will be provided for each industry and product option assisting
the client in defining their needs. The priority of content will be from most broad requirement for industry to most specific requirement in product then
the benefit of choosing such a solution. Details of how solution to be implemented and supported on sepearte page in two sections.

SKELETON

8) How will the interface, navigation and information be layed out?
With use of Balsamiq Wireframes: JWS logo as header and nav bar (Home, Software Solution, Implementation & Services, Contact Us) and JWS details 
as footer. Home page will be an introduction to JWS (1st section), what we do and which industries (2nd section) and products (3rd section) we cover. Software 
Solution page will start with range of industries at top working down to products and software solutions available. Implementation & Services page will detail 
how we will implent the software solutions (1st section) and how we will support it (2nd section). Final Contact Us page will provide a form to fill out 
requesting further information.

SURFACE

9) What will the visual design look like?
Colour theme will be blues, white, greys and red with full width content to be scrolled up and down in coloured sections.Font will be Ariel with emphasis on bold 
contrasting colors. Well sentences and paragraphs to ease volume of text content.

FUTURE RELEASES

10) What features would you like to have in the future?
The site would preferably have user interfacing demonstrations where inputs can be mimicked by the user and outputs relayed dependant on the data.
It would have to be visual and reflect interface of the indicator (control panel) selected. There would also be more graphics to further explain how the
software works and how we would implement the solution. This would allow the client to get a real world example of how the software would work and the 
process of implementation and support. Reasons why this could not be done at the time include lack of skillset on my part to create such functions and time
constraints in order to gather sufficient graphics and test the functionality.
